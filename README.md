# `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` Example - Swift

This is a reproduction in Swift of a simple Objective-C app written by Ash Furrow which shows an example of subclassing UICollectionViewFlowLayout.
From the original, this app demonstrates the following:

- Custom 'UICollectionViewFlowLayout' subclasses.
- How to implement 'UICollectionViewCell' subclasses.
- How to change layouts (with animation).
- How to set up a collection view without a `.xib` or a Storyboard.

See the original repository [here](https://github.com/ashfurrow/UICollectionViewFlowLayoutExample)
